WEBVTT

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.460
Okay, may I ask you a question, the first one?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.600
Right. What is the worst thing about being young?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.640
Well, you get lots of homework

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.280
It's also pretty it's like in the middle

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.060
like it's all like in the middle of bad and good

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.640
Oh

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.800
What is the worst thing about being old?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.340
Not being able to do things, that you could do when you were young.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.940
-Um -Like, uh, you can't bend down and get stuff on the floor?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.860
Well, I can still do that.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.520
But, the problem is, you're body gets a bit stiff

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.020
-Oh, I know, it hurts a lot when you try to bend down          -yeah

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.620
That's right, yes.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380
You might get sick, more often.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.500
Hopefully I don't.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.220
But that's the problem.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.840
That's pretty bad

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.920
It is pretty bad

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.960
The only time I went to the hospital was my mom didn't like getting me born.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.640
Ah, yeah. Do you wish you were older?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.680
Maybe...  Like, so if i were old, I could buy stuff for my own, and be married, but-

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.980
That would be ew.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.660
Do you wish you were young? Why?

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.240
Well, uh, the problem about, uh the great thing about being young is

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.980
You have more time

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.620
You have more time to do things.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620
I could play games-

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.880
Which I did, I used to play Cowboys and Indians.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.340
Yeah, that's what I play!

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.920
Do you?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.420
Yeah!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.180
That's what I like about being young.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.560
I could use my imagination more.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.360
That's sad story, you can't do that anymore.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.220
Well... I could be an older cowboy.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.220
I might do it, yes.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.180
Will you fall in love?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.700
And what will it be like?

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.300
I don't know. Like, we'll have babies and it will be like fun...oh I'd have to change

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.920
Even though I'll have to change his diaper. It'll be fun!

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.680
Oh.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380
But what if he cries?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.700
Ahh well.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820
I'll just sing like Ed Sheeran to him

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520
And, who do you love now?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.040
Um...

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.380
My mom.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.380
Your mom? Your dad?

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380
I like my dad I like my family.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.200
Did you fall in love? What was it like?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.920
Yes, uh-

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120
It was different for me.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560
I fell in love, late.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.220
And did you get married?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.620
No, unfortunately, my partner, she passed away she died.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
That was a sad thing. Yeah. She got sick.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.840
I'm gonna cry.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.700
No, no don't. No, no, no. No.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.760
No ah no no.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
You see, these things happen, Shawn. That's life.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.880
But,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540
We, we have I have very good memories

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.020
Very good memories. And you life, a lot of the time you live in your head with those memories.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.880
You can remember all the good things, and that's the important thing.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800
Well, the advice I would give to you Shawn,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.040
uh

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.060
Is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.320
You don't have to be rich to be happy

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.940
Do the things you like to, and that make you feel good.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.000
Because when you're happy yourself, everybody else is happy.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.480
Shawn do you have any advice for Gordez?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.560
To like, act normal.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.380
Don't be silly

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.560
Don't bully lots of people.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.100
The people I know in school like my friend Alex in school

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.080
Whenever he gets hurt I hug him.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.780
It might not be able to work but.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.160
No, that's good advice, uh

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.420
And, be yourself don't let other people tell you what you should be.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Just be as you are, isn't that true?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.580
Yeah.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.420
And, I'm sure your life is going to be very successful

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.540
You have all the right things.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.540
You have all the right things to do.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.120
All your good friends.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.120
And uh, keep those friends going.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.320
And keep life going oh! There you go.
